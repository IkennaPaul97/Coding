Chapter 1
-----------------------------------
An editor is used to create the text files that contain the C++ code. There are two different types of
files:
• Source files
Source files contain definitions of global variables and functions. Each C++ program consists of at
least one source file.
• Header files
Header files, also called include files, provide the information needed in various source files.
This includes:
• Type definitions, e.g. class definitions
• Declarations of global variables and functions
• Definitions of macros and inline functions\

1.1.3 Compilers
A translation unit consists of a source file and the included header files. The compiler generates an
object file (also called module) from each translation unit; the object file contains the machine
code. In addition to the compilers that generate the machine code directly, there are also C++ into
C translation programs, so-called »C-Front-Compilers«. They translate a C++ program into a C
program. Only then is the object file created with a standard C compiler.

The linker combines object files into an executable file. Besides the self-generated object files, it
also contains the startup-code and the modules with the used functions and classes of the standard library.

***To print text on the screen, we need a C++ class called iostream

***The #include directive includes frequently used functions into the source code
and makes them usable within the program

using namespace std;
Specifies the namespace in which all library elements are declared in C++

The first line #include <cstdlib> is only used to include system statements like
system("pause"); and system("cls“); and can be omitted if these statements are not used.

STL – Standard Template Library
The STL provides functionalities for these containers, such as search and sort functions or insert and delete operations.
